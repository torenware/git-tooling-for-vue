# Getting Go Webapps to Integrate Vue 3 Components

This repo is an experiment in getting a Go based web server to load and
integrate Vue 3 components.

I've been playing with this idea for a while: trying to figure out how
the Vue build system works so I can get Go to expose the correct components
via Golang handlers, renderers, and templates. I did not get this to
work with the old Vue 3 build system, but since [Evan You of Vue.js fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vue.js#History) decided
to write himself the new [Vite build system](https://vitejs.dev/) and loader, I thought it might
be a good time to try this again.

This test build does the following:

* I have a simple Go-based web server with a couple of pages implemented.

* I've code to analyze a Vite-based dist/ directory, and use Go 1.16 embedding to probe the Vite based assets. I've added template logic to decorate the Go page adding the link, script and style sections to serve the Vite assets with the generated page.

* I have a simple Makefile and vite.config.ts file that rebuilds the Vue 3 app as needed, and runs go via `go run`.

* The Vue app is a non-trivial demo of a Vue 3 form with client side validation.


This is a work in progress, but I may write this one up for fun and such.

## Vue 3 + Typescript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and Typescript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

### Recommended IDE Setup

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar)

### Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS

Since TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports, they are shimmed to be a generic Vue component type by default. In most cases this is fine if you don't really care about component prop types outside of templates. However, if you wish to get actual prop types in `.vue` imports (for example to get props validation when using manual `h(...)` calls), you can enable Volar's `.vue` type support plugin by running `Volar: Switch TS Plugin on/off` from VSCode command palette.
